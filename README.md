# Personal Projects
List of private-listed projects are as follows:

1. <b>Mini-git</b> -- A local version-control system that can run and execute Git commands, such as add, remove, commit, branch, status, log, and checkout through serialization and I/O File manipulation.


2. <b>Lines of Action AI</b> -- An AI for the game Lines of Action using minimax algorithms, heuristics, and alpha-beta pruning.



3. <b>Enigma Encrpytion & Decryption Software</b> -- A text encrpytion & decryption software that mimics the rotor, reflector, and plugboard mechanics of an Enigma machine.





Please email me at leejohn24@berkeley.edu to view these projects. 

I have made these projects private because they were used for my Data Strucutres class (CS61B) and I do not want my code to assist potential cheating for students in future semesters.
