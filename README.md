# Private-Projects
List of private-listed projects are as follows:

1. Mini-git
A local version-control system that can run and execute Git commands, such as add, remove, commit, branch, status, log, and checkout through serialization and I/O File manipulation.


2. Lines of Action AI

An AI for the game Lines of Action using minimax algorithms and alpha-beta pruning. Also includes heuristics designed to make the AI win ~30% of the games against myself (a decent player).



3. Enigma Encrpytion & Decryption Software



Please email me via leejohn24@berkeley.edu to view these projects. 
I have made these projects private because they were done for my Data Strucutres class (CS61B) and I do not want my code to assist for potential cheating in future semesters.
